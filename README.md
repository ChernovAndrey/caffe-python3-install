# python caffe guide

This is a collection of guides regarding running caffe and deep learning models with python to help people who struggle at getting them up and running.

*Note: It seems in Ubuntu 17.04 you can now install caffe with apt-get (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html). Please try the instruction in the official guide first and only use this guide if thing went wrong or you want to install caffe from source.*

### why python3, ubuntu 17.04

Well, as a developer I can't wait to try the latest version possible, with new features but also risky: dependencies are not maintained, paths change and break things, etc. So if you are like me then these guides is for you
